Today marks day one of my summer in Europe! It as been quite a crazy couple of weeks for myself. I aspired to write a few posts between when I posted my last one and now; however, perpetual circumstance in this season of transition did not relent. Here are a few moments I was able to be a part of in the past couple of weeks:

- Two beautiful weddings for some of my favorite people!
- My own undergraduate commencement.
- My sister's high school graduation (shout out to Carolyn).
- Tender coversations with friends.
- Packing up everything I own to prepare to move to Texas after my JV internship.

It feels as though my college graduation was yesterday, but at the same time, I was itching to get on the plane to Europe.

### God is moving.

Although my post-grad time has been short and I have scarcely had time to process and reflect, here are some things that God has been laying on my heart:

- Suffering and joy are intuitively thought of as inversely proportional. Although suffering does not ellicit a joyful response in of itself, there is a perspective toward suffering we obtain once we are united with Christ that shows us that it is God's workmanship perfecting us, making us whole.
- Lately, I have been learning how to grieve well!
- My missionary summer internship is **so significant, but not ultimate**. It is also a part of God's greater plan to redeem and restore humanity, just like your workday, or your friendships! We have a role to play in the main story, but we are not the main story.
- This summer will be an amazing learning experience. I am so excited!
- I want to abide in Christ, as I am united with Him in His death and resurrection. *Perichoresis* is the theological term for how the persons of the trinity relates to each other. It is though of as a dance - I too want to dance with God in this beautiful, messy, but calculated manner, letting him lead me. My salvation is my invitation into this dance with God!

### Looking Ahead

Upon touchdown in Prague I will (Lord willing) be picked up by [Josh Dietz](https://www.josiahventure.com/people-and-places/czech-republic/4089), my original connection to Josiah Venture, and I will hop on a train to Ostrava, Czechia. After spending the night with my intern director, I will head to Krakow on a bus to start the Josiah Venture Amazing Race, a part of intern training! Stay tuned for fun stories.

### An Invitation to Prayer

I'd love to invite you to prayer over:

- My intern team as we learn how to encourage one another and work as a team.
- My intern director, [Josh Nelson](https://www.josiahventure.com/people-and-places/czech-republic/3876), as he will be leading us the whole summer.
- The camps ministry for Josiah Venture, and all of the students who are going to be coming to camp!

Thanks for partnering with me in my summer missionary internship!
