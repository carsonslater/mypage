### I have great news!

By the grace of God, I have been able to raise all of the necessary funds to spend the entire summer in the Czech Republic! Thank you to everyone who chose to contribute financially! I want to continue to invite you into deeper relationship via mutual prayer and encouragement. Praise be to God! He is so faithful. This season has been a season full of His provision. Here are some things you can be praying for:

- Pray for the missionaries who are promoting the camps right now in the Czech Republic!
- Pray for the churches who are putting together the camps. There are a lot of logistical details that need to be worked out. Pray that the Lord will bring ease and peace to those people making those decisions.
- Pray that the other interns on my team can be supported! If you were planning on giving to me but have not yet done so, I encourage you to support the other two interns who will be serving with me throughout the summer, [Petr](https://www.josiahventure.com/give-form/?designation=49767846-1ca9-4e5a-a0db-8b6742d781fe&user=54334) and [Lydia](https://www.josiahventure.org.uk/uk-giving?id=54081)!
- Pray for intern directors who are organizing provisions for my team and myself, that they would be able to do this with ease!
- Lastly, pray for the war in Ukraine üá∫üá¶. We as Christians would do well to petition the Lord for peace.

I am so excited to see how the Lord is going to work this summer. I am also grateful that He has invited all of us into participating in His kingdom work.

### Having **BOLD** Faith
Over my spring break (a month ago), I was feeling the weight of my future. I was wrestling with the uncertainty that lay ahead of me. My good friend would say that I was aware God is on His throne, but I was not trusting in that His plan is what is best for me and for His glory.

While in Arizona a little over a month ago, I went for a walk. I was praying and was prompted to read Mark 9.

The narrative begins in verse 14. Jesus was just coming down the mountain after the transfiguration, when he was bombarded by a crowd of people. They were originally surrounding the disciples who had not ascended the mountain with Jesus. A demon-possessed boy was brought before Jesus, who was told his disciples could not cast the demon out of the boy. Verses 20-24 read:

>"They brought the boy to Him. When he saw Him, immediately the spirit threw him into a convulsion, and falling to the ground, he began rolling around and foaming at the mouth. And He asked his father, "How long has this been happening to him?" And he said, "From childhood. It has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, take pity on us and help us!' And Jesus said to him, ‚ÄòIf You can? All things are possible to him who believes.' Immediately the boy‚Äôs father cried out and said, `I do believe; help my unbelief.'"

After reading this, I wept. I couldn't help but notice how the boy's father had said "*If You can do anything...*" I was faced with the reality that too often, when I ask the Lord for things, I possess a posture of doubt. "God, *if* you can...[insert petition]." The problem with this is if I truly believe sanctification looks like my desires growing more consistent with the Lord's desires, then I should have no problem believing that God can and will grant my petitions.

I need to be mindful to walk the line between being comfortable and full of faith in my prayers, yet acknowledging that God is so much more than a granter of requests. Our end game is to be united with Him in His death and resurrection, and to embody Him to others so that they might come to know Him. Part of this looks like our desires becoming His. If this is the case, I can boldly approach His throne with full confidence, acknowledging that He is faithful! (Hebrews 4:16)

### Thanks be to God

Thanks be to God for this opportunity to be a part of this summer ministry. The Lord is more than capable of anything we can ask or imagine. I want to thank everyone who has chosen to support me via financial provisions or prayer, and I would love to invite you into more prayer. Stay tuned for more prayer updates, and in the meantime, let me know how I can pray for you in the [contact form](https://carsonslater.com) on the homepage!
