title: Welcome to my blog!
---

## What even is this?
- **What**: This is a place where I plan on sharing my thoughts, experienes, and things I have found to be encouragements in my life!
- **Why**: This blog is inspired by my desire to encourage people to follow Jesus. More specifically, I was inspired by a practice my church group did when we were serving in the Czech Republic through an organization called [Josiah Venture](https://www.josiahventure.com), where we [blogged](https://fbcaz.com/all-good/) about our experiences to bring our local church body alongside us our Journey.
- **To Whom**: The intended audience for this blog is anyone who is partnering with me in my endeavors to share the gospel with youth. While my intended audience is limited, this blog is actually for anyone and everyone! Please join in praying for me as I prepare to spend my summer as an intern with Josiah Venture!

## What do you plan on posting here?
I hope to share with you my experiences preparing for my JV summer internship, as well as my experiences during the internship. After my time in Czechía, I will be able to reflect on the things that God was showing me along the way!\
\
I also have ambitions to publish some of my own writing here - mainly about books I want to review, ideas I want to share, and things I would love to invite you to consider!

## What is [JosiahVenture](https://www.josiahventure.com)?
Josiah Venture is a mission organization focused on raising up youth leaders in Central and Eastern Europe. Their mission statement can be found on their website, but I've retrieved it here for you:

><div align="left">"This is the vision of Josiah Venture, a vision for a movement of God among the youth of Central and Eastern Europe that finds its home in the local church and transforms society. Our mission and calling is to equip young leaders to fulfill Christ’s commission by reaching and making disciples. More than just conversion, we want to see passionate followers of Jesus Christ, with a vision to reach and disciple their generation for him."</div>

The heartbeat behind Josiah Venture is actually derived from the story of King Josiah of Israel  
([read here](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/2CH.34.ESV)). He inherits the throne of Israel at age eight. He did what was right in the eyes of God, purged the nation of places reserved for idol worship, and sought to reorient the people to follow God once again. As an organization, Josiah Venture seeks to find and raise up more Josiah's across Central and Eastern Europe.

## How will you be serving?
I will be serving alongside the current Josiah Venture missionaries that are already in Czechía by partnering with local churches to promote, plan, and facilitate English Camps across the country.

## Can you give me a preview of what this will look like somehow?
I can't exactly look into the future, but I imagine it will look similar to the camp I served last summer, when my church in AZ partnered with a [local Czech church](https://www.cbtesin.cz/en/). Check it out [here](https://youtu.be/h3TBU2FuNTE)!

## Conclusion
I hope I anticipated the questions you might have. If not, feel free to contact me with more questions via the form on the home page. I was led to create this blog in December 2022, and it is super fun to finally see it come to fruition. Glory be to God, and may this page be one that is edifying to all who read it!\

My hope and prayer is that if you have chosen to let Jesus rule over your life, that you may be spurred on to love and good works (Hebrews 10:24), and that if you do not yet have Jesus as the ruler of your life, that you’d stick around for the sake of curiosity. After all, I’ll probably be posting more than just summer preparatory items on here! \
